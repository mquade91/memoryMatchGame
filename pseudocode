Front End Developer Code Test

Memory Game Test

-Create a simple memory game
-You can use whatever frameworks or open source packages youâ€™d like.
-The game should be delivered in a zip file that, upon unzipping, will open in the browser (chrome) and work without any additional steps. Please deliver this file via Google Drive or Dropbox, as apparently Google blocks .zip files that contain .js files.

Game Requirements

-Alternating turns between a red and a blue player

  Cards clicked
